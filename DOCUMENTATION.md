Existing content of the ABSTRACT section.

## 2. EXISTING SYSTEM
### Traditional ADHD Diagnosis Methods
- Clinical interviews
- Rating scales
- DSM-5 criteria
- Psychological testing

### Limitations of Traditional Methods
- Subjectivity
- Time-intensive
- Cultural bias
- No biological markers

### Previous EEG-based Research Studies (1990s-2020s)
Performance comparison of various studies showing the evolution and effectiveness of EEG-based diagnosis.

### Why Current Systems are Insufficient
Discussion on the inadequacies of current ADHD diagnosis systems and the need for innovative solutions.

## 3. PROPOSED SYSTEM
### System Overview
